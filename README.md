Local Chat Simulator

## Description

A local chat for exams.

Please refer to the video: [üìΩÔ∏è Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JnsTEYAk6huxw6Dj0CiHY3k6JUxKw4fm/view?usp=sharing) (It is advisable to opt for downloading due to the video resolution limitations of the Google Drive player.)

## Minimum Requirements

- Users can input their names and enter the chat room.
- Users can input another username when opening a brand new browser tab.
- If a username has been entered in a browser tab, the name should be kept after refreshing the tab.
- Names can be duplicated across tabs and are treated as the same user. A join message won't be duplicated if the user is already logged in, and the leave message will only be appended when all of the user's tabs are closed.
- The scrollbar remains at the bottom unless manually scrolled away from the bottom (consider all possible scenarios).
- When a message is sent by me (current tab's user), the scrollbar automatically scrolls to the bottom.
- Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> sends the message, and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> sends line breaks.
- Messages containing only spaces or line breaks are not allowed to be sent.
- Showcase and pitch your design enhancements in the pull request.

## Bonus Features

- Unleash your creativity to enhance functionality or improve the user experience.

## Technical Expectations

- Use TypeScript, React hooks, and function components to develop the application.

- Clean and readable code style is encouraged!

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style to name your branch, commit(s), and pull request.
